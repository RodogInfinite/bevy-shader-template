# Bevy Rendering Template

A basic template for working with shaders in Bevy. Based on the [Shader Instancing](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/shader/shader_instancing.rs) example and on descriptions from the [Bevy Cheatbook](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/gpu/stages.html)

Not tested on local windowing, only in the browser. Trunk is currently used to serve content on port 3000. Run with `trunk serve` if a different port is required, then modify the Trunk.toml file.
